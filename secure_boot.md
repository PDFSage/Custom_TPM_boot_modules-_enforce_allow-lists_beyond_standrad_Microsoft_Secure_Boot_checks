It seems like the user is running into issues with unavailable cmdlets like Export-SecureBootPolicy and Import-SecureBootPolicy, likely due to the script targeting cmdlets that may only be available on Windows 10+ systems. I need to guide the user on disabling or removing a custom Secure Boot policy without those cmdlets. I'll suggest checking Windows version compatibility and show possible steps depending on their system's Secure Boot configuration.

It seems like the user is encountering problems with Secure Boot cmdlets, possibly due to using an older PowerShell version or an unsupported OS. To resolve this, they can either install the SecureBoot module on Windows 10+ or use UEFI firmware settings. If cmdlets like Export-SecureBootPolicy aren’t recognized, likely the system isn’t in UEFI mode or the module is missing. As a workaround, booting into UEFI/BIOS settings and resetting to factory keys can help clear any custom policies.

To remove or disable a custom Secure Boot policy, we need to recommend alternatives, especially since PowerShell cmdlets aren’t available. The best approach is to go into the UEFI firmware settings:

Reboot and press the OEM-specific key (e.g., F2/Del/Esc).

Navigate to Secure Boot settings and switch to "Custom".

Choose "Restore Factory Defaults" or "Reset to Setup Mode" to clear keys.

Alternatively, they can disable Secure Boot entirely by switching it to "Disabled", though this could introduce security risks.
